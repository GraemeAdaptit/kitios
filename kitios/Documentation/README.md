### Contribution guidelines ###

No guidelines yet, apart from the overall comments that

(1) the design of KIT is documented in the LibreOffice file KIT Design Document.odt;

(2) all interaction with SQLite is kept inside the file KITDAO.swift - the rest of the code is straight Swift code; and

(3) comments about the software design are contained in comments in the source code.

### Whom do I talk to? ###

Owner of the BitBucket repo is Graeme Costin; when this app reaches releasable stage
it will most likely be an open source freeware app provided by Wycliffe Bible Translators.
